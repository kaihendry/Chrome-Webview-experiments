# BUGS

URLs that redirect aren't captured by chrome.tabs.onUpdated

For example, example.com redirects to http://www.iana.org/domains/example and
the closeURL is not matched. :(

# TODO

## Build test suite

## Hash as well as params

Currently webview.js is iterating through ?search params. It should proabably do #hash params too.

# the onclose callback [url](https://members.wholesaleappcommunity.com/svn/rmprojects/devicespecs/Ipanema/trunk/Ipanema/html/deviceapis/webview/index.html#the-url-attribute) is a little unclear to me

onclose events function should proabably return a location object to avoid creating a URL element to access url.hash or url.search
